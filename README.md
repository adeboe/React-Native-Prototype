# SER402-React-Native-Prototype
This is meant to be a small project to demonstrate the knowledge I learned regarding React Native.

This project is also meant to be a reference for my team for the semester if the team decides to
go for React Native, as we might plan on using React Native to make it easier to create a mobile 
version of the existing web app, making it easier for the homeless to access the web-app in a more
mobile-friendly way.

## How to Install (Windows 10)
First, install *Python* (at least version 3.10.7) and *Node Package Manager* (a.k.a. `npm`).

Then, open the terminal and run the following commands (ignore the `> `):
```
    > pip install django
	> pip install djangorestframework
	> pip install django-cors-headers
```

Finally, download the repo.
